Used Cars Price Prediction Dataset
The dataset consists of 7253 rows and 14 columns.
● There are missing values in the Engine, Power, Seats, New_price, and Price columns.
● Price : The price of the used car in INR 100,000 (Target Variable)
● Kilometers_Driven values have an incredibly high range. We should check a few of the extreme
values to get a sense of the data.

Problem Definition and Objective
● There is a huge demand for used cars in the Indian Market today. As sales of new cars have slowed
down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past years and is
larger than the new car market now. Cars4U is a budding tech start-up that aims to find footholes in
this market.
● In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around 4 million second-hand
cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the
demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car owners replace their old cars
with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones. Used cars are very different beasts with huge
uncertainty in both pricing and supply. Keeping this in mind, the pricing scheme of these used cars
becomes important in order to grow in the market.
Objective:
● Explore and visualize the dataset.
● Build a model to predict the prices of used cars.
● Generate a set of insights and recommendations that
